### **Service vs Component in Spring Boot** 
In Spring Boot, **@Service** and **@Component** are both used for **bean declaration and dependency injection**, but they have different semantic meanings and use cases.

### **Short Difference: @Service vs @Component**  

| Feature        | `@Component` | `@Service` |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Purpose**  | Generic Spring bean | Business logic layer |
| **Use Case** | Utility/helper classes | Service classes (business logic) |
| **Spring Behavior** | Bean scanning | Bean scanning + AOP support |
| **Example** | `EmailValidator` | `LoanService` |

ðŸ”¹ **Use `@Component`** for generic utilities.  
ðŸ”¹ **Use `@Service`** for business logic and transactions.
