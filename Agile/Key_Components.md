Agile has several key components that make it effective for software development and project management. Here are the most important ones:  

### **1. Agile Values & Principles**  
- Defined in the **Agile Manifesto**, which prioritizes:  
  1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
  2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
  3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
  4. **Responding to change** over following a plan  

### **2. Iterative & Incremental Development**  
- Work is broken into small, manageable **iterations** (sprints in Scrum)  
- Continuous **feedback** and **improvements** after each iteration  

### **3. Agile Frameworks & Methodologies**  
- **Scrum** â€“ Uses sprints, stand-up meetings, and a product backlog  
- **Kanban** â€“ Visualizes workflow with boards and limits work-in-progress  
- **Lean** â€“ Focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing value  
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** â€“ Emphasizes coding standards, testing, and pair programming  
- **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)** â€“ For large organizations adopting Agile  

### **4. Agile Roles**  
- **Product Owner** â€“ Defines requirements, prioritizes backlog  
- **Scrum Master (or Agile Coach)** â€“ Facilitates Agile processes, removes impediments  
- **Development Team** â€“ Self-organized, cross-functional team delivering the product  

### **5. Backlog Management**  
- **Product Backlog** â€“ A list of prioritized features and improvements  
- **Sprint Backlog** â€“ Selected tasks for the current iteration  

### **6. Daily Stand-ups (Daily Scrum in Scrum)**  
- Short meetings (usually 15 minutes) to discuss:  
  - What was done yesterday?  
  - What will be done today?  
  - Any blockers?  

### **7. Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**  
- Frequent code integration, automated testing, and regular releases  

### **8. Agile Artifacts (Specific to Scrum)**  
- **Product Backlog** â€“ List of all tasks/features  
- **Sprint Backlog** â€“ Tasks planned for a sprint  
- **Increment** â€“ A working version of the product  
- **Burndown Chart** â€“ Tracks work progress in a sprint  

### **9. Feedback & Retrospectives**  
- **Sprint Review** â€“ Demonstrating completed work  
- **Sprint Retrospective** â€“ Analyzing what went well, what can improve  

### **10. Customer Collaboration & Stakeholder Involvement**  
- Continuous communication with customers and stakeholders for feedback  

### **11. Adaptability & Continuous Improvement**  
- Agile welcomes changes at any stage  
- Teams constantly refine their process
